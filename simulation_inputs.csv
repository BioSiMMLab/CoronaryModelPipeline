parameter,value,note
phase1,True,flag that checks if position and angles are varied. only one phase (from 1 to 3) can be true and the remainder must be false
phase2,False,flag that checks if only diameter ratios are varied
phase3,False,flag that checks if tortuosity is imposed
phase5,True,flag that checks if plaque is imposed. Note that this can be combined with phases 1 through 3
allo_scale,False,scales cardiac parameters  such as mean flow based on model volume Mainly appropriate to include this in phase 3
non_circular_diams,False,set this to true if you wish to impose eccentric lumens randomly.
num_geometries,16,the number of geometries you wish to generate in total
num_cycle,4,number of cardiac cycles you wish to simulate
